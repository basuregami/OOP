## Class

> Class in Object-oriented programming, is like a template often time also refers as blueprint for creating Object. Object is an indiudal instance of the data strucutre defined by the class. Example

```php
       class User {
           public $firstName;
           public $lastName;

       }
```

### Constructor

> A constructor in a class allows us to initizlize an object's with additonal properties upon creation of the object. The construct function start with two undersoces (\_\_)!. Example

```php
       class Test {
           public function function __construct(){

           }

       }
```

t

> A destructor in a class refers to special type of function which will be called automatically whenever an object is deleted or goes out of scope.
